silly_app
   Silly_app is a very simple android app of absolutely no use. 
   It was just developed to see, how to create an app using android framework.
   Framework 2.2 was used for development.
   You can try the apk in the release folder v1.0. Should run on all Android versions 2.2 and up.
   Silly_app does not need any rights. 
   Check the small java sources to see, that it does nothing than controlling a progress bar, which is shown in the app.
